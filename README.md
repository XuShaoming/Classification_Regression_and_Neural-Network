# Classification_Regression_and_Neural-Network
Here are my solutions for CSE574 Machine Learning course at University at Buffalo in Spring 2018.

### Project 1: 
Implemented LDA and QDA models and a Non-linear ridge regression model on biomedical data and investigated the impact of bias, regularization parameters on mean squared error.

### Project 2: 
Implemented a multilayer Neural Network, compare it with deep Neural Network and Convolutional Neural Network to investigate the impact of varying lambdas, hidden units, layers, iterations on accuracy and time.

### Project 3: 
Implemented single and multiple Logistic Regression models on MNIST dataset with over 92% accuracy on test sets. Then implemented the support vector machine by sklearn library.
